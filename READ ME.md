Design 2:

### Design Choice Reasoning

I chose the first design with the help of feedback from Adam & Mitchel. 

I chose Design 1 because its minimalist layout aligns well with the company's branding of simplicity and elegance. The clean and uncluttered design enhances user experience by focusing on essential elements, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate the website and find the information they need without distractions.

Adam: the first design seems more clean and not so many buttons pushed in my face and with the colors not so in your face either.

Mitchel: Design 2 seems very un-organized, the buttons seem scattered and the color scheme chosen seem to be too bright and colorful for the intended purpose. Design 1 seems a much better alternative, it has a seamless button layout, I know where the buttons are and I know they are interactable.

### Colour Scheme

I picked blue and dark grey colors because they make the website look professional and trustworthy. Blue gives a feeling of stability and integrity, making visitors feel secure. Dark grey goes well with blue and makes the design look stylish and modern.

### Typography

Choosing Arial is a good idea because it's clear, easy to read, and widely available. Arial is a simple, straightforward font that ensures website content is legible and accessible to all users. Its familiarity also enhances user experience, as visitors are likely accustomed to seeing Arial on various platforms, making navigation and comprehension smoother.

## Navigational Map

|           | About Us | Our Employees | Careers |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| About Us  |     ✓    |       ✓      |    ✓    |
| Employees |     ✓    |       ✓      |    ✓    |
| Careers   |     ✓    |       ✓      |    ✓    |

All pages link back to each other with no issues, you can seamlessly go from About Us to Careers back and then to Our Employees.

## Known Issues

1. Issue: Side scrolling, the website should not be side scrolling and seems to be broken (minor issue)
2. Issue: Buttons Not Working, some of the buttons broke when adding new CSS to the About Us. (major issue) (fixed)

## Testing Phase

- Verify all links and buttons perform their intended actions without errors.
- Evaluate website layout and design for user-friendliness and intuitive navigation.
- Test the website across different web browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Measure page load times to ensure optimal performance across devices and network conditions.

### Results

Firefox testing:

Chrome testing:

Both of these look exactly the same, they both had no size, squishing or oddities happening with the browsers, these are the top browsers and decided to use these for my testing.

The website does not function on Mobile devices. 

### Speed Testing

I used PageSpeed for the speed performance and got expected results:

## Feedback

### Adam

The website works well for what it's meant to do. It's not too detailed, but you still get what's going on. The colors look good and don't hurt your eyes. The layout is nice, not annoying. It's easy to switch between pages and read the text.

### Mitchel

The website functions smoothly for its intended purpose, hitting a balance between providing enough detail without overwhelming the user. The color scheme is pleasant and easy on the eyes, while the layout is visually appealing without being distracting. Navigating between pages is seamless, and the text is legible and easy to read. Overall, it's a positive experience to move through the site and access information effortlessly.

### Responding to feedback

The lack of detail could definitely be improved upon in version 2.0 of the website, there will be much more detail where users can identify and do much more with the webpage. The color scheme was very effective as it's visually appealing and not so abrasive on the eyes while hitting a good decent balance of color, readability and seamless transition.

### Layout

The layout was simple and straightforward, designed with attention to ensuring easy navigation for all users. Its simplicity ensures that anyone can quickly find their way around the site. The homepage features three clear buttons, each providing concise details about its respective section as soon as the page loads.

### Conclusion

In summary, I believe the website's design fulfills both user and client needs. It aligns well with the target audience due to the design choices made. Additionally, the site's navigation and usability are enhanced by these decisions. Furthermore, the design contributes to the website's visual appeal and informative nature.

### Development

While coding the website, I focused on maintaining clean and clear code by ensuring proper spacing and naming conventions. This approach facilitates easier comprehension and modification for others without excessive time investment. However, I recognize the need for adding comments to enhance code clarity, both for others and for future reference. Additionally, I prioritized code maintainability and optimization for potential future updates.

While building the website, I used Visual Studio Code and GitHub to save different versions quickly, making things easier. GitHub also helped me test the site on different devices and web browsers. Basically, using Visual Studio Code with GitHub was the best way to make the website smoothly.
